# NovaBrew Brand Guidelines
*Last updated: June 2024*

---

## Brand Essence

NovaBrew exists to connect curious coffee drinkers with exceptional beans from around the world. We believe great coffee should feel personal, not generic. Every cup should be a small discovery.

## Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Roast Brown | #5C3D2E | Primary brand color, headers, logo |
| Warm Cream | #F5F0E8 | Backgrounds, card surfaces |
| Terracotta | #C65D3E | Accents, CTAs, highlights |
| Forest Green | #3A5A40 | Sustainability messaging, secondary accents |
| Espresso Black | #1A1A1A | Body text |
| Latte Beige | #D4C5A9 | Borders, dividers, subtle elements |

Palette is warm, earthy, inviting. Avoid cold blues and sterile grays. We want the brand to feel like a well-lit coffee shop on a Saturday morning.

## Typography

- **Headers:** Playfair Display (serif) — warm, editorial, approachable luxury
- **Body:** Inter (sans-serif) — clean, readable, modern
- **Accents/Callouts:** DM Mono (monospace) — for tasting notes, data, labels

## Voice & Tone

**We are:**
- Friendly but knowledgeable (the barista who remembers your order AND can explain terroir)
- Curious and enthusiastic (we genuinely geek out about coffee and want you to join us)
- Warm and conversational (like texting a friend who happens to know a lot about coffee)
- Confident but never arrogant (we know our stuff but we're not snobs about it)

**We are NOT:**
- Pretentious or gatekeeping ("You MUST use a pour-over or you're doing it wrong")
- Corporate or formal ("Dear valued customer, we appreciate your patronage")
- Bland or generic ("Great coffee. Great value. Subscribe now.")
- Preachy about sustainability (we do it because it's right, not to lecture you)

**Example copy:**

> *Yes:* "This Kenyan AA has bright berry notes that'll make your morning feel like a good plot twist."
> *No:* "This premium Grade AA Kenyan features distinguished notes of Saskatoon berry with complex acidity."

> *Yes:* "Not sure what you like? That's what we're here for."
> *No:* "Take our proprietary coffee assessment to optimize your flavor profile alignment."

## Values

1. **Discovery** — Every bag is a chance to try something new. We're guides, not just vendors.
2. **Sustainability** — Direct trade relationships, compostable packaging, carbon-neutral shipping. We don't compromise here.
3. **Community** — We're building a community of coffee lovers, not just a customer base.
4. **Quality** — We'd rather have fewer roaster partners and higher standards than the other way around.
5. **Honesty** — If we mess up, we say so. If we don't know something, we admit it.

## Photography Style

- Natural light, warm tones
- Real moments (morning routines, kitchen counters, home offices)
- Hands holding cups, beans being poured, steam rising
- Never staged or sterile. Never stock photo energy.
- Show the people behind the coffee — roasters, farmers, our team

## Logo Usage

Logo: Wordmark "NovaBrew" in Playfair Display with a small coffee bean icon replacing the 'o' in Nova. Use the full wordmark where possible. Bean icon can be used alone as a favicon/social avatar.

*Note: These guidelines were written when the brand launched and haven't been revisited. Some of the voice guidelines (especially around personalization and "knowing your order") describe an experience we aspire to but don't currently deliver. Updating these to reflect the current reality — or, better, building the product to match the brand promise — is an open item.*
