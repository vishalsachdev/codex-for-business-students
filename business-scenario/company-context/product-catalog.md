## Known Product Gaps

*Documented by product team, unaddressed:*

1. **No pause option** — Customers must cancel and re-subscribe. Causes unnecessary churn.
2. **No frequency customization** — Monthly only. Many customers want bi-weekly or every 6 weeks.
3. **No taste preference capture** — Signup only collects roast level preference. No flavor, origin, brewing method, or adventurousness data.
4. **No feedback mechanism** — No way for subscribers to rate bags or communicate what they liked/didn't.
5. **Tier differentiation unclear** — Tiers differ mainly by bag size/quantity, not by curation quality. Customers expect Connoisseur to mean "better selection," not just "more coffee."
6. **Recommendation engine limitations** — Current system filters by roast level and avoids repeats. Does not use any personalization data. Effectively random within broad roast category.
7. **No coffee personality/profile system** — Discussed extensively, never built. See campaign-quiz-attempt.md for history.
