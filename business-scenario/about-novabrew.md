# NovaBrew Coffee Co.

**"Your perfect cup, delivered."**

## Company Overview

NovaBrew is a direct-to-consumer coffee subscription company headquartered in Austin, TX. Founded in early 2022 by three friends who believed the coffee subscription market was broken — too generic, too impersonal, too forgettable.

## Founders

- **Maya Chen** (CEO) — Former specialty barista and Q Grader. Spent 6 years at Intelligentsia and Counter Culture. Knows coffee better than anyone in the building. Tends to over-index on product quality and under-index on retention mechanics.
- **Jordan Reeves** (CMO) — Ex-growth marketer from Casper and Daily Harvest. Built NovaBrew's early brand identity and acquisition engine. Great at getting people in the door; less clear on keeping them.
- **Sam Okafor** (CTO) — Former backend engineer at Shopify. Built the subscription platform, inventory system, and the (somewhat questionable) recommendation engine. Stretched thin across too many priorities.

## Key Metrics (as of last month)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Active subscribers | 8,200 | Down from 15,000 peak (Feb 2025) |
| Monthly churn rate | ~12% | Industry average is ~6% |
| Monthly burn rate | ~$45,000 | Includes salaries, COGS, marketing, ops |
| Runway remaining | ~8 months | At current burn, assuming no revenue growth |
| Average revenue/subscriber | $22.40/mo | Blended across tiers |
| LTV (current) | ~$187 | Was $320 at peak retention rates |
| CAC (blended) | ~$38 | Paid channels trending higher |

## Funding

- **Series Seed**: $800K raised in mid-2022 from two Austin-based angel investors and a small CPG-focused fund (Roast Ventures — yes, that's their real name).
- No Series A conversations yet. Investors have made it clear that a credible retention story is a prerequisite for any follow-on funding.

## The Problem

NovaBrew has a **front door / back door problem**. Acquisition has never been the issue — Maya's coffee is genuinely excellent, Jordan's marketing gets people to try it, and first-bag satisfaction scores are high (4.6/5.0 average).

But something breaks after that first bag. Subscribers sign up excited, receive their first shipment, love it — and then quietly cancel 2-3 months later. Exit surveys are vague ("just not for me anymore", "trying to cut spending", "didn't use it fast enough"). The real reason feels deeper, but nobody has pinned it down.

The team has tried various retention tactics (loyalty points, seasonal blends, referral bonuses) with limited success. There's a growing suspicion that the core issue is **personalization** — or rather, the lack of it. The recommendation engine Sam built was a v1 prototype that never got iterated on. It essentially randomizes from available inventory with light filtering by roast preference.

Maya has been talking about a "coffee personality" concept for months — the idea that every subscriber should feel like NovaBrew *knows* them — but it's never been built into anything concrete.

## Team Size

12 full-time employees:
- 3 founders
- 2 customer support reps
- 1 operations/fulfillment manager
- 2 marketing associates
- 1 part-time data analyst (started 3 months ago, still getting oriented)
- 1 roasting partnerships manager
- 2 warehouse/fulfillment staff

## Your Role

You've just been brought on as a **strategy consultant/intern** — a short-term engagement to help the founders figure out what's actually going wrong and build a data-driven plan to fix it. Maya describes your mandate as: "We have a lot of data, a lot of opinions, and not enough clarity. Help us figure out what to do next."

You have access to everything the previous PM left behind (it's messy), the company's financial data, customer feedback, and the team's full attention for the next few weeks. The founders are open-minded but running out of time and money.
