## Notes

The UGC was great and we're still using some of those photos in our marketing. But participation was heavily skewed toward already-engaged, long-tenure subscribers. The people who shared were promoters (NPS 9-10) who were going to stay anyway. The campaign didn't reach or engage the at-risk subscribers who are most likely to churn.

Dev noted something interesting: "A lot of the posts included captions describing their specific taste preferences — 'I'm a light roast fruity coffee person' or 'dark and bold all the way.' Our subscribers have strong taste identities. They want to be known for their preferences. A coffee personality profile could tap into this — people would share their 'coffee personality type' like they share their Enneagram or MBTI." This is a good insight that connects to the personalization conversation.
