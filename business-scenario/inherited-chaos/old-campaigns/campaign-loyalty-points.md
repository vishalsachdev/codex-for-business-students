# Campaign: Loyalty Points Program
**Dates:** April - July 2025
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Incentivize long-term subscription retention through a points-based rewards system.

## Details

Subscribers earn points for:
- Each month subscribed: 100 points
- Referring a friend: 250 points
- Leaving a review: 50 points
- Social media share: 25 points

Points redeemable for:
- Free bag: 500 points (5 months subscribed)
- Branded mug: 300 points
- Brewing guide: 150 points

## Results

- **Enrollment rate:** 34% of active subscribers opted in
- **Monthly engagement with points dashboard:** 8% (of those enrolled)
- **Points redeemed:** Only 12 free bags claimed in 3 months
- **Churn impact:** No statistically significant difference between enrolled and non-enrolled subscribers
- **Program cost:** ~$2,800 (development + rewards fulfilled)

## Notes

The loyalty program felt corporate and mechanical. Subscribers didn't engage with it because the rewards weren't compelling and the points accumulation was too slow. Jordan's post-mortem: "People don't stay subscribed to a coffee company because of points. They stay because they love the coffee they're getting." Maya was blunter: "This is a solution to the wrong problem. We don't have a loyalty problem. We have a relevance problem. People aren't leaving because they're disloyal — they're leaving because we're sending them coffee they don't love." Program was quietly sunset in July.
