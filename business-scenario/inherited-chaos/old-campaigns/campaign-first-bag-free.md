# Campaign: First Bag Free Promotion
**Dates:** January 2025
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Maximize new subscriber acquisition with an aggressive trial offer.

## Details

Full-size bag of curated coffee, completely free (just pay $3.99 shipping). Promoted through paid social (Instagram, TikTok), Google Ads, and influencer partnerships. Landing page with simple signup — name, email, address, roast preference (light/medium/dark). First paid shipment starts month 2.

## Results

- **New signups:** 2,800 in one month (highest acquisition month ever)
- **CAC:** $11.50 including ad spend + COGS of free bag (normally $38)
- **Roast preference captured at signup:** Yes, but not used by rec engine
- **Month 2 conversion (free → paid):** 52% (1,456 subscribers)
- **Month 3 retention (of those who converted):** 38%
- **Month 6 retention:** 14%
- **Net subscribers retained after 6 months:** ~200 out of 2,800 original signups

## Notes

This was our biggest acquisition win and our biggest retention failure. The free bag attracted deal-seekers and casual coffee drinkers who were never going to become long-term subscribers. The 48% who never converted to paid were essentially just getting free coffee. And those who did convert churned at nearly 2x our already-bad baseline rate.

The math is brutal: we spent ~$32,200 on the campaign (ads + free bags + shipping) and retained about 200 subscribers generating ~$4,480/month. Payback period: 7+ months, and most of those 200 will probably churn before then.

Jordan's takeaway: "The offer was too aggressive. We attracted the wrong audience." Maya's takeaway: "Even the right audience would churn if we can't personalize the experience. We asked for their roast preference and then ignored it." Both are correct.
