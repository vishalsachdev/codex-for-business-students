# Campaign: Subscriber Preference Survey (ABANDONED)
**Dates:** Started August 2025, abandoned September 2025
**Owner:** Alex (PM) — left the company before completion
**Goal:** Collect subscriber taste preferences to improve personalization and reduce churn.

## Background

This was supposed to be the big one. After months of customer feedback pointing to a lack of personalization, Alex started building a subscriber preference collection tool that would:

1. Ask subscribers 8-10 questions about their taste preferences
2. Generate a subscriber taste profile (Maya's concept)
3. Match subscribers to specific coffees in our catalog based on their profile
4. Evolve over time based on feedback and ratings

The project was inspired by Driftaway's taste profile system but intended to be more sophisticated — incorporating not just roast/flavor preferences but also brewing method, adventurousness, caffeine sensitivity, and origin preferences.

## What Got Built

- **Quiz questions drafted:** 12 questions written, refined to 8 after feedback from the team
- **Profile framework:** Maya defined 6 "Coffee Personality" archetypes:
  1. The Purist — light roast, single origin, clean flavors, pour-over
  2. The Adventurer — loves trying new things, exotic origins, unusual processing methods
  3. The Comfort Seeker — medium roast, familiar flavors (chocolate, caramel, nutty), reliable
  4. The Bold One — dark roast, strong flavors, espresso-focused
  5. The Explorer — bit of everything, rotates preferences, values variety over consistency
  6. The Connoisseur — nuanced palate, cares about processing method, terroir, and seasonality
- **Landing page:** A rough wireframe was created in Figma (never finished)
- **Backend:** Nothing. Sam said he'd need 2-3 months to rebuild the recommendation engine to accept profile data as inputs. With the Shopify migration and other priorities, engineering bandwidth was zero.

## Why It Was Abandoned

1. **Engineering bottleneck:** Sam couldn't allocate time to rebuild the rec engine. Without backend integration, the quiz would be "theater" — collecting data we couldn't act on.
2. **PM departure:** Alex left the company in mid-November. No handoff documentation beyond the messy notes in this folder.
3. **Scope creep:** The project grew from "simple quiz" to "full personalization engine" without anyone scoping a minimum viable version.
4. **No champion:** With Alex gone, nobody owned the project. Maya believes in it but is stretched thin as CEO. Jordan is focused on acquisition. Sam is underwater.

## What's Left

- Alex's draft preference questions (in a Google Doc — ask Maya for access)
- Maya's taste profile framework (napkin sketch + the 6 archetypes above)
- The A/B test results showing that even 3 basic taste questions improved retention by ~7 points
- Tessa's suggestion to start with Driftaway's simple 4-profile model and iterate
- Customer demand: 15% of survey respondents unprompted asked for a preference/profile system
- A half-built Figma wireframe somewhere in the design folder

## Status

**STALLED / ABANDONED.** No one is currently working on this. The team agrees it's the right direction but lacks the bandwidth to execute. Maya has called it "the most important thing we're not doing."

## Why This Matters

Every other retention tactic NovaBrew has tried (loyalty points, seasonal blends, referral bonuses, discounts) has failed to meaningfully move the churn needle. The preference/personalization concept is the only initiative that showed real signal in testing (the A/B test). Customer feedback overwhelmingly supports it. Competitors who have personalization (Trade, Driftaway) retain better.

This abandoned campaign is arguably the most important artifact in NovaBrew's history. The idea is right. The execution stalled. Someone needs to pick it back up.
