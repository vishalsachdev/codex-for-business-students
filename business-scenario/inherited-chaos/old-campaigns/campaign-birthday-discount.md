# Campaign: Birthday Month Discount
**Dates:** Ongoing (launched May 2025)
**Owner:** Tessa Kim
**Goal:** Add a personal touch and reduce churn during subscriber birthday months.

## Details

Subscribers who provided their birthday during signup receive:
- 20% off their birthday month shipment
- A birthday card in the box with a handwritten-style message
- A small sample of a premium single-origin (bonus item)

## Results

- **Subscribers with birthday on file:** 62% of active base
- **Redemption rate:** 94% (essentially everyone who got it stayed through their birthday month)
- **Customer feedback:** Overwhelmingly positive — "This was so sweet!", "Love the personal touch"
- **Churn impact during birthday month:** 3% (vs 12% baseline) — great!
- **Churn impact in month after birthday:** 15% — worse than baseline
- **Net annual churn impact:** Statistically insignificant

## Notes

Customers loved the gesture. The birthday card and sample were a genuine delight moment. But it didn't change the underlying retention curve — it just shifted when people churned (they'd wait until after their birthday to cancel). Tessa was disappointed but noted: "The birthday campaign proved that personal touches matter. People responded to feeling recognized. If we could make EVERY month feel this personal — not with discounts, but with coffee that actually matches their taste — that's the real version of this idea."
