# Campaign: Limited Edition Seasonal Blend
**Dates:** October 2024 (Fall blend), December 2024 (Holiday blend)
**Owner:** Maya Chen
**Goal:** Create excitement and reduce churn through exclusive, limited-time offerings.

## Details

Maya developed two custom blends:
- **"Autumn Ember"** — a cozy medium roast blend (Brazilian + Colombian) with chocolate and caramel notes
- **"Midnight Solstice"** — a bold holiday blend (Sumatran + Ethiopian) with spice and dark fruit notes

All active subscribers received the seasonal blend as their monthly shipment. Promoted heavily on social media with custom packaging.

## Results

- **Social engagement:** 3x normal for blend announcement posts
- **Customer satisfaction:** 4.5/5.0 on Autumn Ember, 4.2/5.0 on Midnight Solstice
- **Churn during seasonal months:** 10% (vs 12% baseline) — slight improvement
- **Month after seasonal blend:** Churn spiked to 14%. Net effect approximately zero.
- **Revenue impact:** Negligible — same subscription price, slightly higher COGS for custom blending

## Notes

People liked the seasonal blends. The custom packaging and storytelling created genuine excitement. But it didn't solve the underlying retention problem — it just delayed it by a month. Sending *everyone* the same blend also meant some people got a coffee they didn't enjoy (the Midnight Solstice was polarizing — dark roast lovers loved it, light roast people hated it). This actually reinforces the personalization problem: even our best marketing moments fail when we don't match to individual taste.
