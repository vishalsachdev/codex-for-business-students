# Campaign: Win-Back Email Series
**Dates:** September - October 2025
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Reactivate churned subscribers with a targeted email sequence and incentive.

## Details

3-email sequence sent to subscribers who canceled in the past 90 days:
1. **"We miss you"** — Emotional appeal + 25% off next 2 months (Day 1)
2. **"Here's what's new"** — Highlight new roaster partnerships and seasonal offerings (Day 7)
3. **"Last chance"** — Urgency-driven, 30% off for 48 hours (Day 21)

Sent to 1,840 churned subscribers.

## Results

- **Email 1 open rate:** 31%
- **Email 2 open rate:** 22%
- **Email 3 open rate:** 18%
- **Total reactivations:** 147 (8% of those emailed)
- **Discount cost:** ~$1,100 in revenue reduction
- **Retention of reactivated subscribers at 60 days:** 34% (only 50 still active)
- **Retention of reactivated subscribers at 90 days:** 22% (32 still active)

## Notes

The win-back sequence got some people back, but most of them churned again within 2 months. The discount brought them in the door but didn't fix the reason they left in the first place. Jordan noted: "We're spending money to re-acquire people into the same broken experience. The reactivation email should say 'We've built a taste profile system and now we can match you to coffee you'll actually love.' Without that, we're just repeating the cycle."

One bright spot: 23 of the 147 reactivated subscribers responded to a follow-up survey. Their #1 request? "Actually learn what I like this time." Several mentioned that if NovaBrew had a way to capture and act on their preferences, they'd consider coming back permanently. One wrote: "I'd resubscribe in a heartbeat if you had a taste quiz like Trade Coffee. The coffee quality is better at NovaBrew — you just don't know what to send me."
