# Campaign: Welcome Email Series
**Dates:** Ongoing (launched March 2024)
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Onboard new subscribers and set expectations for their subscription experience.

## Details

5-email sequence triggered at signup:
1. Welcome + order confirmation (immediate)
2. "Meet your roasters" — sourcing story (Day 2)
3. Brewing tips based on subscription tier (Day 5)
4. "Your first bag is on its way!" + tracking (Day 7-10)
5. "How was your first cup?" feedback request (Day 14)

## Results

- **Open rate:** 40% average across sequence (industry avg: ~25%)
- **Click-through rate:** 12%
- **Completion rate:** Only 15% of subscribers open all 5 emails
- **Feedback collected:** Email 5 gets a 6% response rate, mostly positive about the first bag

## Notes

Open rates are good but most people drop off after email 2. The "Meet your roasters" email actually has the highest engagement — people love the origin stories. But the sequence doesn't capture any taste preferences. It's purely informational. We're talking AT subscribers, not learning FROM them. Alex suggested inserting a taste preference survey into the sequence (between emails 2 and 3) but it never got implemented. The A/B test he ran separately showed this could improve month 2 retention by ~7 percentage points.
