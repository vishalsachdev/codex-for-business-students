# Campaign: Coffee + Equipment Bundle Deal
**Dates:** March 2025
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Increase average order value and provide a "complete experience" to new and existing subscribers.

## Details

Three bundles offered at a discount:
- **Starter Kit:** Explorer subscription + Hario V60 dripper + filters ($42 — 25% off buying separately)
- **Home Barista:** Enthusiast subscription + Baratza Encore grinder ($149 — 20% off)
- **Ultimate Setup:** Connoisseur subscription + grinder + scale + gooseneck kettle ($229 — 30% off)

Promoted via email to existing subscribers and as an add-on during new subscriber checkout.

## Results

- **Bundles sold:** 218 total (142 Starter, 58 Home Barista, 18 Ultimate)
- **Revenue boost:** $19,400 in bundle month
- **Average order value increase:** 62% for subscribers who purchased a bundle
- **Margin impact:** Gross margin on bundles was 18% (vs ~40% on subscription-only) — equipment margins are thin
- **Retention impact:** Bundle purchasers retained slightly better at 90 days (+4%) but sample size too small to be conclusive

## Notes

Short-term revenue boost but at the cost of margin. Jordan argued it was worth it for the "stickiness" — subscribers who invest in brewing equipment are more committed. Maya pushed back: "We're paying people to stay with hardware discounts instead of giving them coffee they love. Sunk cost fallacy isn't a retention strategy." The team agreed not to repeat this unless paired with a better personalization experience: "If we know their brewing method, we could bundle the RIGHT equipment with the RIGHT coffee. That's a different proposition entirely."
