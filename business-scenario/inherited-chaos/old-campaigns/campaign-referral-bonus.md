# Campaign: Referral Bonus Program
**Dates:** June - August 2025
**Owner:** Jordan Reeves
**Goal:** Drive new subscriber acquisition through word-of-mouth referrals.

## Details

Existing subscribers get a unique referral link. For each friend who signs up:
- Referrer gets $10 credit toward next shipment
- Referred friend gets first bag free

Promoted through email, in-box inserts, and social media.

## Results

- **Referral links generated:** 2,100
- **Referrals converted:** 340 new subscribers
- **CAC on referred subscribers:** $18 (vs $38 blended — looks great!)
- **But:** Referred subscribers churned at 18% monthly (vs 12% overall)
- **60-day retention of referred subs:** 41% (vs 58% for organic signups)
- **Net impact on subscriber base:** Marginal after accounting for elevated churn

## Notes

The referral program was a classic vanity metrics trap. The numbers looked amazing on acquisition — low CAC, good volume. But referred subscribers were less committed from the start. Many signed up for the free bag, stuck around one month, then left. Hypothesis: referred users were motivated by the deal, not by a genuine interest in a coffee subscription. Jordan still thinks the program has potential "with better targeting." Alex argued we should fix the product experience before amplifying referrals: "Don't refer people into a broken experience faster."
