# Marketing Team Sync
**Date:** August 22, 2025
**Attendees:** Jordan Reeves, Tessa Kim (marketing associate), Dev Patel (marketing associate), Alex (PM)
**Location:** Conference room / Zoom hybrid

---

## Agenda
1. August campaign performance
2. September planning
3. Acquisition vs retention debate (again)

## August Performance

**Instagram/TikTok:**
- Followers up 12% month-over-month (now at 34K across platforms)
- Engagement rate: 4.2% (above industry avg of 1.5%)
- Top post: "Behind the roast" video of our Guatemalan partner farm — 89K views
- UGC from the social share campaign is strong — people love photographing the bags

**Problem:** Social growth isn't converting to subscribers. Jordan pulled the funnel numbers:
- Social → website visits: strong (18% click-through)
- Website visits → signup: weak (2.1% conversion)
- Signup → first payment: decent (68%)
- First payment → month 3: terrible (54%)

Tessa: "We're great at awareness but something dies between 'oh cool' and 'take my money.'"

Dev: "The website doesn't do a good job of explaining why NovaBrew is different from every other coffee subscription. We say 'Your perfect cup, delivered' but nothing on the site actually delivers on the 'perfect' part. There's no personalization in the signup flow."

## The Acquisition vs Retention Argument

**Jordan's position:** "We need to keep the top of funnel strong. If we cut acquisition spend, we'll shrink faster than churn is already shrinking us. We need both."

**Alex's position:** "Every dollar we spend acquiring a subscriber who churns in 3 months is basically wasted. We're paying $38 to acquire someone who generates maybe $67 in revenue ($22.40 x 3 months) against ~$25.50 in COGS. The math doesn't work until we fix retention."

**Tessa (quietly):** "What if we spent some of the acquisition budget on making the *experience* better for existing subscribers? Like, what if we built that taste quiz thing Maya keeps talking about and promoted it to current subscribers as an 'upgrade your experience' thing?"

**Jordan:** "I like the quiz idea conceptually but we tried to build one and it went nowhere. Who's going to build it?"

**Alex:** "The A/B test I ran showed that even asking 3 basic taste questions improved engagement. Imagine a real quiz that actually connected to what we ship. That could be the 'why NovaBrew' story we're missing."

**Dev:** "Trade Coffee's whole value prop is 'we match you to your perfect coffee.' They built a quiz that takes like 2 minutes. It's not rocket science."

**Jordan:** "Fine, but Trade had $20M and a team of engineers. We have Sam, and Sam is busy."

## September Plans

- Continue organic social (Tessa)
- Scale back paid acquisition by 15% (Jordan reluctantly agreed)
- Dev to create a "why NovaBrew" landing page — attempt to articulate the personalization value prop even though the product doesn't fully deliver it yet
- Alex to push on the taste quiz concept — get a rough spec together *[this never happened because Alex left]*
- Tessa suggested a "subscriber spotlight" email series — interview loyal subscribers about their coffee preferences and routines, share their stories. Approved as low-cost experiment.

## Side Conversation (after the meeting)

Tessa pulled Alex aside and said she's been looking at Driftaway Coffee's approach — they have four simple taste profiles (fruity, balanced, classic, bold) and it works. She thinks NovaBrew is overcomplicating this. "Start with something simple. Four profiles. Let people self-select. Ship accordingly. Iterate from there."

Alex said: "That's basically what I've been saying. But Maya wants something more sophisticated — she has this whole coffee personality framework with like 8 dimensions. And Sam says even simple personalization requires rebuilding the rec engine."

Tessa: "Then maybe we do it manually first? Tag the bags, tag the subscribers, match them in a spreadsheet if we have to. Prove the concept, then automate it."

*[No one followed up on this.]*
