# Board Meeting — Q3 2025 Review
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Attendees:** Maya Chen, Jordan Reeves, Sam Okafor, Diana Voss (Roast Ventures), Marcus Liu (angel investor)
**Note-taker:** Alex (PM) — *[these notes are rough, Alex left before cleaning them up]*

## Financial Update (Maya presenting)

- Q3 revenue: $198K (down from $243K in Q2)
- Active subscribers dropped from 10,400 to 8,900 during Q3
- Monthly churn held steady at ~11-12%. "Held steady" is a generous way to put it — it hasn't gotten worse, but it also hasn't improved despite multiple retention initiatives
- Burn rate: ~$45K/month. Maya says they've been "disciplined" but acknowledged this doesn't include the contractor they want to hire for the rec engine
- Runway: ~10 months at current burn (was 14 months at start of Q3)
- LTV:CAC ratio currently at 4.9:1. Diana noted this needs to be above 3:1 minimum but "trending the wrong direction"

## Unit Economics Deep Dive (Diana's request)

Diana asked Sam to walk through unit economics per subscriber:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Avg revenue/sub/month | $22.40 |
| COGS (beans + packaging) | $8.50 |
| Shipping | $4.20 |
| Payment processing | $0.67 |
| **Gross margin/sub/month** | **$9.03** |
| Allocated CAC (amortized) | $2.71/mo (assuming 14-mo avg lifetime) |
| **Contribution margin/sub/month** | **$6.32** |

Diana's concern: if actual lifetime is closer to 8 months (current trajectory), allocated CAC jumps to $4.75/mo and contribution margin drops to $4.28. "That's tight. Very tight."

## Retention Discussion

**Marcus:** "I keep hearing about retention initiatives but the churn number hasn't moved. What's actually being done?"

**Jordan:** Walked through recent campaigns — loyalty points (low engagement), seasonal blend (good reception but no churn impact), referral bonus (actually made things worse for referred users). Acknowledged that "we're throwing tactics at a strategy problem."

**Maya:** Brought up the coffee personality matching concept again. "Every subscriber should feel like we know their palate. Right now we're essentially a random coffee subscription and that's not defensible." She described a vision where each subscriber takes a taste profile assessment and receives curated selections based on their evolving preferences.

**Sam:** Pushed back gently. "I agree with the vision but the rec engine rewrite is a 3-month project and I'm the only engineer. We just migrated to a new Shopify setup and I'm still fixing bugs from that."

**Diana:** "You need to find a way to do a lightweight version of this. The taste quiz idea from the PM — what happened to that?"

**Maya:** "Alex was working on it but it stalled. We did a partial A/B test that showed promising results but never followed through."

**Diana (getting pointed):** "Let me be direct. You have two quarters to show a credible path to reducing churn below 8%. If you can't demonstrate that by our Q1 review, Roast Ventures will not participate in any follow-on funding. We believe in the product but not the retention trajectory."

## B2B Pivot Discussion

**Marcus:** "Have you considered pivoting to B2B office coffee? The D2C subscription market is brutal and companies like Trade Coffee have massive advantages in personalization tech."

**Maya:** Clearly uncomfortable. "We've had a few inbound requests from offices. I'm not opposed to exploring it but I don't want to abandon D2C when I think the core problem is solvable."

**Jordan:** "We could do both. Office coffee is higher AOV, lower churn, and we already have the supply chain."

**Sam:** "Building a B2B sales motion is a completely different animal. We'd need a sales team, different pricing, account management. That's not a pivot, it's a second company."

**Diana:** "I'd rather see you fix D2C retention than add a new channel. Focus."

**Action item:** Maya to develop a retention improvement plan by end of October. Should include concrete metrics, timeline, and resource requirements. *[Alex was supposed to help with this — now unclear who owns it]*

## Misc Notes

- Sam mentioned the data analyst (Priya) is starting to build dashboards but "it's slow going because our data is messy"
- Jordan wants to increase paid acquisition spend. Diana vetoed: "Don't pour more water into a leaky bucket."
- Next board meeting: January 15, 2026. Diana called it a "decision meeting" — as in, the board will decide on follow-on funding.
