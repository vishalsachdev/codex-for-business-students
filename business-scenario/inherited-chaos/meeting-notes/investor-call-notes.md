Marcus called for an informal check-in ahead of the Q3 board meeting. He was direct, as usual.

## His Questions

**"What's your LTV:CAC ratio right now, honestly?"**
I told him blended LTV is around $187 and CAC is $38, so about 4.9:1. He said that sounds okay until you realize LTV has dropped 40% in 6 months. "A declining LTV with a stable CAC means your ratio is compressing fast. By Q2 next year you could be below 3:1." He's right and I hate it.

**"Who's your actual competitor?"**
He doesn't think it's other subscription boxes. He thinks the competitor is *inertia* — people going back to buying whatever's at the grocery store or just walking into a local cafe. "You're competing against the path of least resistance. The only way to win is to make the subscription feel indispensable, not interchangeable."

**"What's your moat?"**
I said great coffee, strong roaster relationships, and our brand. He pushed back HARD. "Great coffee is table stakes. Your roaster relationships are non-exclusive. And your brand is... fine. It's not a moat." He said Trade Coffee just raised $20M and their moat is their matching algorithm — they've built a personalization engine trained on millions of data points. "What's yours?"

I didn't have a good answer.

**"Have you considered that your subscribers are telling you what they want?"**
He pulled up a few of our NPS verbatims (I'd shared them with the board). Read them back to me:
- "I wish NovaBrew knew what I liked instead of me having to guess"
- "The first bag was great but after that it's been hit or miss"
- "I feel like I'm getting random coffee"

"Maya, three different customers all saying the same thing: *make it personal*. This isn't a marketing problem. It's a product problem."

## His Suggestion

Marcus thinks we need to build what he called a "taste graph" — a way of understanding each subscriber's preferences that gets smarter over time. He compared it to Spotify's Discover Weekly: "Nobody cancels Spotify because the recommendations get better the longer you use it. Your subscription should work the same way."

He acknowledged this is a big engineering lift but said: "You don't have to build Spotify. Start with a simple taste profile — even a quiz — and connect it to what you ship. The key is that the subscriber *feels known.* Right now they feel like a number."

He also mentioned that he's seen AI tools that could help even non-technical teams prototype personalization systems. "There's no excuse in 2025 for not having at least a basic matching system. You don't need a team of ML engineers anymore."

## His Bottom Line

"I'll support the company at the Q1 board meeting IF you can show me:
1. A clear diagnosis of why people churn
2. A credible plan to fix it, ideally involving personalization
3. Early evidence that it's working — even from a small pilot

I don't need you to have solved it. I need to see that you understand the problem and have a plan that makes sense."

## My Takeaway

He's right about all of it. The taste profile / coffee personality thing isn't a nice-to-have — it might be the whole game. The question is whether we can build something meaningful with the team and runway we have.

Alex was supposed to spec this out but now Alex is gone. I need to find someone who can help us think through this strategically and move fast.
