## Top Ticket Categories (by volume)

### 1. Wrong Roast Level / Preference Mismatch (189 tickets — 22%)

Customers report receiving coffee that doesn't match their stated preferences. Most common: signed up for light roast, received dark roast. Second most common: asked for whole bean, received ground (or vice versa).

**Representative tickets:**

> **Ticket #4821:** "I specifically selected light roast when I signed up. This is the second month in a row I've gotten a medium-dark. Please fix this."
> *Resolution: Apologized, sent replacement bag. Checked system — customer's preference was stored but rec engine didn't prioritize it.*

> **Ticket #5102:** "I brew with an AeroPress and you sent me coarse-ground coffee. This is useless to me."
> *Resolution: Sent replacement with correct grind. Note: system doesn't currently track brewing method.*

> **Ticket #5344:** "You sent me decaf. I have never in my life wanted decaf. Where did this come from?"
> *Resolution: System error — customer was tagged as "open to all" by default. Sent regular coffee + credit.*

### 2. Want to Pause Subscription (142 tickets — 17%)

Customers want to temporarily pause rather than cancel. Current system only supports cancel and re-subscribe. Many customers say they'd stay if they could pause for a month or two (vacation, too much coffee backlog, budget reasons).

**Representative tickets:**

> **Ticket #4756:** "I'm going on vacation for 3 weeks. Can I skip next month? I don't want to cancel because I'll forget to re-sign up."
> *Resolution: Manually skipped next shipment. No self-service option exists.*

> **Ticket #5089:** "I have 3 bags unopened. Can I pause until I catch up? I don't want to waste good coffee."
> *Resolution: Paused manually. Suggested they might want to switch to every-other-month. Customer: "That's an option?? Where?"*

> **Ticket #5201:** "I want to pause, not cancel. If you can't pause, I'll have to cancel and I probably won't come back."
> *Resolution: Manually paused. Flagged for product team. Again.*

### 3. Subscription Tier Confusion (118 tickets — 14%)

Customers unclear on what each tier includes. Common questions: What's the difference between Explorer and Enthusiast? Is the Connoisseur bag bigger or just different coffee? Can I mix tiers?

**Representative tickets:**

> **Ticket #4899:** "What exactly am I getting for $24 vs $16? The website just says 'curated selection' for both. That's not helpful."
> *Resolution: Explained differences. Internally noted that tier differentiation is genuinely unclear.*

> **Ticket #5167:** "I upgraded to Connoisseur expecting more exotic coffees but I'm getting the same stuff as when I was on Explorer. What gives?"
> *Resolution: Escalated. Honestly, the tier selection logic is basically the same for all three — it's primarily a bag size/quantity difference, not a curation difference. This is a product gap.*

### 4. Want to Give Feedback / Rate Coffee (97 tickets — 11%)

Customers proactively reaching out to say what they liked or didn't like about recent bags. Currently no structured way to capture this feedback.

**Representative tickets:**

> **Ticket #4803:** "That Colombian from La Palma y El Tucan was the best coffee I've had this year. More like this please!! How do I tell you what I like?"
> *Resolution: Thanked them, made a note in their account (manually). No way to feed this into the recommendation system.*

> **Ticket #5055:** "Is there a way to rate the bags you send? I want to help you help me."
> *Resolution: No formal rating system exists. Told customer we'd "take their feedback into account." Felt bad saying that.*

> **Ticket #5290:** "I've been replying to the shipping confirmation emails with my thoughts on each bag. Does anyone read those?"
> *Resolution: Nobody reads those. They go to a no-reply inbox. Yikes.*

### 5. Shipping Issues (89 tickets — 11%)

Standard shipping delays, damaged packages, wrong address. Not unique to NovaBrew. Mostly handled by ops team.

### 6. Want More Variety (78 tickets — 9%)

Customers who feel they're getting too-similar coffees month after month. Often overlap with preference mismatch complaints.

> **Ticket #5178:** "I've gotten three Central American coffees in a row. I thought the point was variety? Send me something from Africa or Asia."

> **Ticket #5311:** "Every bag has been a medium roast. I signed up for variety but it's Groundhog Day over here."

### 7. Asking for Recommendations (62 tickets — 7%)

Customers asking support reps to personally recommend their next coffee based on what they've liked.

> **Ticket #4987:** "I loved the Ethiopian but didn't like the Guatemalan. I think I prefer fruity over chocolatey. Can someone pick my next bag for me?"
> *Resolution: Support rep (Keisha) personally recommended the Kenyan Nyeri. Customer loved it. Keisha is now this customer's de facto personal coffee concierge. This doesn't scale.*

> **Ticket #5244:** "Is there someone I can talk to about my coffee preferences? Like a coffee sommelier? I'd pay for that."
> *Resolution: We don't offer this. But... should we?*

### 8. Cancellation Requests (72 tickets — 9%)

Direct cancellation requests. Exit reasons when provided:
- "Too expensive" — 28%
- "Getting bored" — 24%
- "Not matching my taste" — 22%
- "Too much coffee / not drinking fast enough" — 15%
- "Switching to competitor" — 8%
- "No reason / just trying it out" — 3%

**Notable:** 34% of cancellation tickets include some version of "if you could just send me coffee I actually like, I'd stay." This is both heartbreaking and actionable.

## Support Team Notes (from Keisha, senior support rep)

"I want to flag something. I've started keeping a personal spreadsheet of customers' taste preferences based on our conversations. When they contact us again, I look them up and can make better recommendations. Customers LOVE this — I've personally saved at least 15-20 people from canceling by just... remembering what they like and suggesting something good.

But this is just me doing this in my spare time. There's no system for it. When Maria handles the same customer, she doesn't know any of this. It's in my head and my spreadsheet.

If we could build something — anything — that captures what customers like and uses it to improve their subscription, I think it would change everything. Even a basic form where they can set preferences would be better than what we have now, which is nothing.

Also: customers keep asking about a taste quiz. Apparently we posted about one on Instagram months ago (some kind of campaign that never launched?) and people are still asking about it. Can we please either build it or stop teasing it?"

The "want to give feedback" and "asking for recs" categories are the fastest-growing. Customers are literally asking us to personalize their experience and we have no mechanism to do it.
