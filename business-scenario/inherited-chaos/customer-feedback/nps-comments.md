## Passive Comments (Score 7-8) — Selected

> "It's good coffee. Not sure it's $24/month good. Might be $16/month good." — Score 7, 4 months

> "Some months are great, some are just okay. Inconsistent." — Score 7, 5 months

> "I like it but I don't love it. Something's missing. Maybe more personalization?" — Score 8, 3 months

> "Solid service. Nothing to complain about but also nothing that makes me want to rave about it." — Score 7, 6 months

> "I wish I could tell you what I like and have that actually matter. Right now it feels like you're just sending whatever." — Score 8, 4 months

> "Good enough to keep but I check other options periodically. Haven't found a strong reason to stay or go." — Score 7, 5 months

> "The novelty wore off around month 3. Now it's just... coffee that shows up." — Score 8, 4 months

> "I'd rate you higher if I felt like you knew me. Right now it's a nice product but an impersonal experience." — Score 7, 6 months

> "Compared to Trade Coffee, you're better on quality but worse on personalization. If you added real personalization, easy 10." — Score 8, 3 months

> "I've recommended you to friends but always with the caveat 'the first bag is amazing, after that it's hit or miss.'" — Score 8, 7 months

**Passive Theme:** These are the swing voters. They acknowledge quality but want a more personalized, intentional experience. Many are one bad month away from churning.

## Detractor Comments (Score 0-6) — Selected

> "Feels impersonal. Like I'm getting the same box as everyone else. There's no 'me' in this subscription." — Score 5, 3 months

> "Just another subscription box. Sign up, get stuff, wonder why you're paying for it, cancel. Tale as old as time." — Score 4, 2 months

> "I told you I like light roast. You sent dark. Twice. I feel like nobody's listening." — Score 3, 3 months

> "I don't feel like they know me at all. After 4 months, shouldn't you have learned what I like?" — Score 5, 4 months

> "Canceled. You had great coffee but zero personalization. Trade Coffee figured out my taste in a 2-minute quiz. Why can't you?" — Score 2, was subscribed 3 months

> "I wanted discovery but with guardrails. Like, surprise me within my comfort zone. Instead it's just random." — Score 4, 3 months

> "The recommendation engine (if there is one) is broken. Sent me the same roaster two months in a row, then a decaf (I don't drink decaf), then something I'd already received." — Score 1, 5 months

> "Nothing about this experience tells me you care about MY preferences. It's one-size-fits-all dressed up as premium." — Score 3, 2 months

> "I've been a customer for 6 months and you still can't predict what I'll like. My local barista figured it out in two visits." — Score 4, 6 months

> "Your tagline is 'Your perfect cup, delivered.' It should be 'A random cup, delivered.' At least that would be honest." — Score 2, 3 months

> "I filled out a preferences form when I signed up. I'm now pretty sure that data goes into a black hole." — Score 3, 4 months

> "The quality is fine. But the selection process feels like you're clearing inventory, not curating for me." — Score 5, 3 months

> "Signed up after seeing your TikTok. Expected personalized coffee curation. Got a generic subscription box with nice branding." — Score 4, 2 months

> "I've tried to give you feedback through email, support chat, and even DMs on Instagram. Nothing changes. My next bag is always random." — Score 2, 5 months

> "My friend and I both subscribe and we got the EXACT same coffee three months in a row. So much for personalization." — Score 3, 4 months

**Detractor Theme:** The #1 complaint across all detractors is lack of personalization. Words that appear repeatedly: "random," "impersonal," "don't know me," "not listening," "generic." These customers don't hate the coffee — they hate the experience of not being seen.

## NPS Trend

| Quarter | NPS | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Q1 2024 | 51 | Post-launch honeymoon |
| Q2 2024 | 48 | Stable |
| Q3 2024 | 44 | Slight dip |
| Q4 2024 | 41 | First signs of trouble |
| Q1 2025 | 38 | Declining |
| Q2 2025 | 35 | Accelerating decline |
| Q3 2025 | 32 | Current |

Trend is clearly negative. NPS is a leading indicator — this decline started 6 months before the subscriber count decline became obvious.

## Analyst Note (Priya)

*I just started so take this with a grain of salt, but looking at the NPS data alongside the survey responses and support tickets, the pattern is overwhelming: customers want personalization and we're not delivering it. The product quality is our strength — that's what keeps the NPS from going below 30. But the selection/matching experience is actively eroding trust and loyalty.*

*If I were prioritizing one thing, I'd build a taste profiling system. Not because it's the only thing that matters, but because it addresses the #1 complaint across every data source I've seen so far.*

*Also: 15% of survey respondents unprompted mentioned wanting a quiz or taste profile. That's remarkable for an unprompted response. Customers are literally telling us what to build.*
