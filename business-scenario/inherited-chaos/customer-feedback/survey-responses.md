## Active Subscribers

1. "Love the beans! The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe I got last month was incredible. But I have no idea how you chose it for me." — Explorer tier, 6 months

2. "Honestly I just like having coffee show up. Don't really think about it. It's fine." — Explorer tier, 4 months

3. "I've gotten three dark roasts in a row. I signed up saying I prefer light roast. What happened?" — Enthusiast tier, 3 months

4. "The quality is clearly there. I can tell you source well. I just wish I had more say in what I get." — Connoisseur tier, 8 months

5. "My coworker got me a gift subscription and I loved it so much I kept going. Best coffee I've had at home." — Explorer tier, 11 months (gift convert)

6. "I joined because of that Instagram video about the Guatemalan farm. The coffee was great. But now it just feels like a generic subscription box." — Enthusiast tier, 3 months

7. "Why don't you ask me what I like? It seems obvious. Every month is a surprise and not always a good one." — Explorer tier, 5 months

8. "I brew pour-over exclusively and some of the beans you send are clearly meant for espresso. The grind is wrong and the roast profile doesn't work. Do you even know how I brew?" — Connoisseur tier, 4 months

9. "I'd pay more if you could guarantee I'd like every bag. Right now it's about 60/40." — Enthusiast tier, 7 months

10. "Love the sustainability angle. That's why I stay. But the coffee selection feels random." — Explorer tier, 5 months

11. "The packaging is beautiful. The unboxing is nice. The coffee is... usually good? Sometimes amazing, sometimes meh." — Enthusiast tier, 3 months

12. "I follow you on Instagram and the brand is great. The product doesn't quite live up to the brand though." — Explorer tier, 2 months

13. "Honestly my favorite part is when I get something I've never tried before and it blows my mind. But that's only happened twice in 6 months." — Enthusiast tier, 6 months

14. "Do you have a way to rate the bags? I want to tell you what I liked so you send more like it." — Explorer tier, 4 months

15. "I gave you a 5-star review on my first bag. I'd give a 3 now. It's not bad, it's just... meh." — Enthusiast tier, 3 months

16. "I wish there was a quiz or something to figure out my taste. I don't even know how to describe what I like." — Explorer tier, 2 months

17. "Your customer support is amazing. Shoutout to whoever handles the chat — they fixed my issue in like 2 minutes." — Connoisseur tier, 9 months

18. "I've been a subscriber for almost a year. I feel like a loyal customer. But I get the exact same experience as someone who just signed up. No recognition, no evolution." — Connoisseur tier, 11 months

## Recently Canceled Subscribers

19. "Just got bored. Same vibes every month. Nothing wrong, nothing exciting either." — Was Explorer, 3 months

20. "I canceled because I had 4 unopened bags sitting on my counter. The shipping pace didn't match my actual consumption." — Was Enthusiast, 5 months

21. "Tried Trade Coffee instead. Their quiz actually matched me with coffee I love. Sorry." — Was Explorer, 2 months

22. "Too expensive for what felt like random coffee. If it was curated for ME, I'd have stayed." — Was Connoisseur, 4 months

23. "I wanted to pause, not cancel, but couldn't figure out how. By the time I called support it was easier to just cancel." — Was Explorer, 3 months

24. "My tastes changed and there was no way to update my preferences. I signed up liking dark roast but now I'm into lighter stuff and kept getting dark." — Was Enthusiast, 6 months

25. "Nothing personal. Just cutting subscriptions. If you'd given me a reason to stay — like really nailing my taste — I probably would have kept it." — Was Explorer, 4 months

26. "I switched to buying directly from roasters I discovered through your subscription. Ironic, right? You introduced me to them and then I went direct." — Was Connoisseur, 7 months

27. "The first bag was SO good. Like, perfectly matched to what I love. Then it went downhill. Did you bait and switch me?" — Was Enthusiast, 2 months

28. "I canceled and resubscribed twice. Each time I hoped it would be different. It wasn't." — Was Explorer, total 5 months

29. "My partner and I have completely different tastes. We needed two different subscriptions. That's too expensive." — Was Enthusiast, 3 months

30. "I got the same roaster three months in a row. Variety is supposed to be the point." — Was Explorer, 4 months

## Patterns from Full Dataset (analyst notes)

**Top reasons for satisfaction (active subscribers):**
- Coffee quality (mentioned by 78%)
- Convenience (61%)
- Sustainability/sourcing story (34%)
- Packaging/unboxing (28%)

**Top reasons for dissatisfaction (all respondents):**
- Lack of personalization / "feels random" (52%)
- Can't update or communicate preferences (38%)
- Shipping frequency doesn't match consumption (29%)
- No feedback mechanism (24%)
- Gets boring / repetitive after a few months (22%)
- Received wrong roast level for stated preference (18%)

**Key Insight:** Satisfaction is driven by product quality. Dissatisfaction is driven by the *selection process*. People love the coffee when it matches their taste; they churn when it doesn't. The gap between "we have great coffee" and "you get the right great coffee" is where retention dies.

**Unprompted mentions of wanting a quiz/profile/matching system:** 47 out of 312 respondents (15%) — this was not a survey question, they volunteered it.

31. "You should do what Spotify does — learn what I like and get better over time." — Was Explorer, 3 months

32. "If you had a taste quiz I'd probably still be a subscriber. Just sayin." — Was Enthusiast, 2 months

33. "I'm a pour-over light roast person who likes African and Central American beans. If you shipped me exactly that, I'd never cancel. But you never asked." — Was Connoisseur, 4 months

34. "I told support I like fruity coffees and the next month I got a classic Brazilian. Did anyone write it down?" — Was Explorer, 3 months

35. "The gifting experience was great. The ongoing experience felt like you forgot about me." — Was Enthusiast, 4 months

36. "Great concept, mediocre execution. You need some kind of recommendation system. Even Amazon can figure out what I like." — Was Explorer, 2 months

37. "Signed up for 'Your perfect cup, delivered.' Got 'A random cup, delivered.' Disappointed." — Was Enthusiast, 3 months

38. "I actually like the idea of discovering new coffee but not COMPLETELY random new coffee. I want guided discovery, like a sommelier who knows my palate." — Was Connoisseur, 5 months

39. "My first month was a light roast Kenyan with berry notes. Perfect. Next month was a dark roast Sumatra. Opposite of what I want. Did the system reset?" — Was Explorer, 2 months

40. "I've subscribed to 4 different coffee services. The one I kept? Trade. Because they actually ask what I like." — Was Enthusiast, 3 months

41. "Nice people, nice brand, nice coffee. But 'nice' doesn't justify $24/month. 'Perfect for me' would." — Was Enthusiast, 4 months

42. "Would love to see a profile page where I can set my preferences and see how my taste evolves over time." — Active, Explorer tier, 5 months

43. "I rated my last three bags in a reply email but I don't think anyone read it." — Active, Enthusiast tier, 4 months

44. "Started sharing my NovaBrew bags with my coffee group. Everyone's taste is different. It'd be cool if you offered a group subscription where everyone gets matched individually." — Active, Connoisseur tier, 8 months

45. "I want to trust that you're picking something great for ME, not just something you need to move out of inventory." — Active, Explorer tier, 3 months

46. "Gets repetitive. I wish there was more of a journey — like, teach me about coffee while personalizing what I get." — Active, Enthusiast tier, 6 months

47. "I'm a simple person. Medium roast, chocolatey, from Central America. Just send me that every month and I'm happy forever." — Active, Explorer tier, 9 months

48. "My wife and I argue every month about whether the bag is good. We need individual matching." — Active, Enthusiast tier, 5 months

49. "I keep meaning to cancel but also keep forgetting. That's probably not the loyalty you're going for." — Active, Explorer tier, 4 months

50. "I had a call with your support team and they manually recommended a few coffees based on what I described liking. Those were the BEST bags I've gotten. Why can't the regular subscription work like that?" — Active, Connoisseur tier, 7 months

51. "Started buying your one-time bags instead of the subscription because at least I can pick what I want." — Recently downgraded, was Enthusiast

52. "You're going to lose me soon. Fair warning. Send me something I actually love next month and I'll reconsider." — Active, Explorer tier, 3 months
