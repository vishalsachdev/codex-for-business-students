# Competitor Profile: Driftaway Coffee

**Website:** driftaway.coffee
**Founded:** 2014
**Funding:** Small seed round (undisclosed), primarily bootstrapped
**HQ:** Brooklyn, NY

## Overview

Driftaway Coffee built their entire subscription around a simple taste profiling system. They categorize all their coffees into four taste profiles: **Fruity**, **Classic**, **Bold**, and **Balanced**. New subscribers receive a tasting kit with samples from each profile, pick their favorite, and all future shipments match that profile. Subscribers can switch profiles anytime and provide feedback that refines future selections within their profile.

## What They Do Well

- **Simple personalization framework**: Four profiles is easy to understand, easy to choose, and easy to operationalize. No algorithm needed — just tagging and matching.
- **Tasting kit onboarding**: Letting subscribers taste before choosing is brilliant. Removes guesswork. Builds engagement from day one.
- **Feedback integration**: Subscribers rate each bag and can add tasting notes. This data informs which specific coffees within their profile they receive next.
- **Transparency**: Each bag includes info about the farmer, the region, and why it fits the subscriber's chosen profile.
- **Community**: Strong brand loyalty among their subscriber base. Small but passionate.

## Weaknesses

- **Small scale**: Limited roaster partnerships and coffee variety compared to Trade or even NovaBrew.
- **Rigid categories**: Four profiles might oversimplify. A subscriber who likes fruity AND chocolatey coffees has to pick one.
- **No journey/evolution**: Once you pick a profile, it's static. No concept of taste evolution or guided discovery.
- **Limited reach**: Primarily serves a niche audience in the specialty coffee world. Marketing and brand awareness are low compared to competitors.
- **Inventory constraints**: Small operation means sometimes the selection within a profile is limited.

## Relevant to NovaBrew

Driftaway is the most directly relevant competitor for NovaBrew's personalization challenge. Their four-profile system proves that **simple personalization works** — you don't need a sophisticated algorithm to make subscribers feel matched. NovaBrew has more roaster partners (47 vs. Driftaway's ~15) and more SKUs, which means we could offer a richer personalization experience if we had even a basic matching framework.

Tessa on the marketing team already flagged Driftaway as a model to study. Maya's "coffee personality" concept is more ambitious (8 dimensions vs. 4 profiles) but Driftaway shows that even a simple version moves the needle.

The tasting kit idea is worth exploring — could NovaBrew send a sampler as month 1 of the subscription instead of a full bag? Use it to calibrate preferences?

**Key learning:** Personalization doesn't have to be complex to be effective. A simple, well-executed framework beats a sophisticated system that never gets built.
