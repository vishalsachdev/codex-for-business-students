** "Codex for Business Students"**  
*(Learn Codex *in* Codex – Built for MBAs, Undergrad Biz Majors, PMs, Analysts & Aspiring Founders)*

The original “Claude Code for Everyone” (and its excellent PM variant at ccforpms.com) is perfect meta-learning: zero-to-hero inside the AI tool itself.  

We now adapt it **specifically for business students** — people who need to move fast on real business problems (class projects, case competitions, startup ideas, internship deliverables, consulting decks, internal tools) but have zero interest in becoming engineers.  

**New Course Name:**  
**Codex for Business**  
**Tagline:** “The only course taught *inside* Codex that turns business ideas into working prototypes in hours — not weeks. If you can pitch, you can build.”

**Target Audience**  
- MBA / undergrad business students  
- Product managers & aspiring PMs  
- Finance / marketing / ops analysts  
- Non-technical founders & side-hustlers  
- Anyone who wants to prototype MVPs, automate workflows, or speak fluent “tech” in meetings  

**Why Business Students Love This Version**  
- Every lesson uses **real business scenarios** (customer research synthesis, financial models, lead-gen tools, pitch-deck generators, internal dashboards, competitor analysis agents, etc.)  
- ROI is immediate: finish a class project in one evening, ship a startup MVP over a weekend, create portfolio pieces that get you hired  
- No generic “todo app” — you build tools you can actually put on your resume or show investors

### Step-by-Step Conversion Plan (1–2 weeks with Codex doing 80% of the work)

**Phase 0: Setup (1 day – do this today)**  
1. Fork the original everyone-course repo (or the PM-course repo — better starting point).  
2. Rename → `codex-for-business-course`  
3. Install the Codex desktop app for Mac.  
4. Tell Codex:  
   `"You are now my co-creator for Codex for Business. Analyze the Claude Code PM course structure and output a full mapping + business-student version of every module with new project examples."`  
   (Codex will generate 90% of the content for you.)

**Phase 1: Branding & Website (1–2 days)**  
- Mirror the beautiful Nextra site exactly (same Next.js setup).  
- New domain: codexforbusiness.com or codexforbs.com (point via Vercel).  
- Update every page:  
  - Hero: “Business students & PMs — stop waiting for engineers. Build your own prototypes today.”  
  - Testimonials section: “Used it to ship my MBA capstone MVP in 4 hours — got an A+ and investor meetings.”  
- Add business-student specific screenshots (Codex can generate the entire app visuals).

**Phase 2: Course Materials (3–5 days – Codex does most)**  
Create `course-materials/` with business-flavored starter projects and lesson scripts.

**Adapted Module Structure** (still ~4–5 hours total)

**Module 0: Getting Started (20–30 min)**  
- Install Codex + clone the course.  
- First prompt: “You are my Codex Business Coach. Confirm you’re ready and summarize what a business student will build by the end of this course.”  
- Outcome: Personalized welcome + your first business tool (e.g., automated meeting-note summarizer).

**Module 1: Fundamentals for Business (2.5–3 hours)**  
1.1 File ops & context → Process real case-study PDFs, earnings transcripts, survey data.  
1.2 Visual workspace → Split-screen for building pitch decks + financial models side-by-side.  
1.3 Parallel agents → Launch three agents at once: Market Researcher + Financial Modeler + UX Critic.  
1.4 Custom Skills & AGENTS.md → Build permanent agents: “VC Roaster”, “Competitor Intelligence”, “Go-to-Market Strategist”.  
1.5 Business command shortcuts → Create reusable templates for OKRs, PRDs, financial projections.  
1.6 Data & Excel/Google Sheets automation → Codex writes Python scripts you can run instantly or connect via APIs.

**Module 2: Business Vibe Coding (1–2 hours)**  
- Mindset: “Describe the business outcome, not the code.”  
- Planning interview: Codex runs a Socratic session exactly like a PM would do with stakeholders.  
- Build & iterate:  
  - Lesson 2.1: Customer interview synthesizer + insight dashboard  
  - Lesson 2.2: Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) for your startup idea  
  - Lesson 2.3: Investor-ready live demo + one-click deploy  
- Version control & GitHub: Codex handles PRs and READMEs so they look professional.  
- Go live: Deploy to Vercel + optional Stripe test checkout for SaaS feel.

**Bonus Business-Only Module (optional, 30–60 min)**  
- “Capstone Project”: Turn your actual class idea / side hustle / internship problem into a shipped tool.  
- Export portfolio assets (live URL, GitHub repo, 1-page case study Codex writes for you).  
- “Use Codex to ace your next case competition” mini-lesson.

**Phase 3: Make It Truly Meta & Business-Ready**  
- Write all lessons and AGENTS.md *inside Codex* using the business-student persona.  
- Test the entire course by running it fresh in Codex.  
- Include a “Codex for Your Career” section: how to talk about this skill in interviews (“I shipped 5 MVPs using Codex…”).

**Phase 4: Polish & Launch (1–2 days)**  
- One-click zip download of course-materials for students.  
- Deploy to Vercel.  
- Optional: Paid tier with private community / office hours (Carl’s model works great).  
- Launch post: “Built this for my fellow business students — no more ‘I don’t code’ excuses.”
